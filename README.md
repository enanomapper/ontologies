The Ontology
============

The eNanoMapper ontologies aim to provide a comprehensive suite of ontologies for the nanomaterial safety assessment domain (see http://www.enanomapper.net for project information). The full suite of ontologies can be found assembled by imports in the primary enanomapper.owl file.

The ontology is being developed and maintained by the following EU H2020 projects (see also the below
[funding](README.md#funding) info):

* [NanoCommons](https://www.nanocommons.eu/)
* [OpenRiskNet](https://openrisknet.org/) (project ended)
* [eNanoMapper](http://enanomapper.net/) (project ended)

Other NanoSafety Cluster projects that have contributed by providing feedback and collaborations
include [NANoREG](http://www.nanoreg.eu/), [NanoReg2](http://www.nanoreg2.eu/),
[GRACIOUS](https://www.h2020gracious.eu/), and [NanoSolveIT](https://www.nanosolveit.eu/).

External
--------
We import slices from third party ontologies. The Slimmer tool is used to extract the bits we include
in the eNanoMapper ontology. The slimmed files can be found in the [external](external) folder.
The full list of ontologies it includes is:

* [Adverse Outcome Pathways Ontology](https://github.com/DataSciBurgoon/aop-ontology) (AOP)
* [BioAssay Ontology](http://bioassayontology.org/) (BAO)

Opening the ontology in Protégé
===============================

The stable version can be opened in [Protégé](https://protege.stanford.edu/) with the following step:

1. File → Open from URL...
2. enter the URL http://enanomapper.github.io/ontologies/enanomapper.owl

The development version is opened in the same way, but with a different URL:

1. File → Open from URL...
2. enter the URL http://enanomapper.github.io/ontologies/enanomapper-dev.owl

Building and validating the ontology
====================================

During (and after) the eNanoMapper project the ontology was autobuilt using scripts on
[a Jenkins server](https://jenm.bigcat.maastrichtuniversity.nl/). The main OWL file (enanomapper.owl)
refers to slimmed versions of external ontologies, complemented with internal files adding additional
terms. The slimming of the external ontologies is done with the Slimmer tool, with these commands (for the
BioAssay Ontology):

```shell
rm -f *.owl
rm -f *.owl.*
wget -O bao_complete.owl http://www.bioassayontology.org/bao/bao_complete.owl
rm -f bao.props*
rm -f bao.iris*
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/enanomapper/ontologies/master/config/bao.props
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/enanomapper/ontologies/master/config/bao.iris
java -cp ../Slimmer/target/slimmer-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT-jar-with-dependencies.jar com.github.enanomapper.Slimmer .
```

The bao.props and bao.iris files contain all the information needed to describe which parts of the BAO ontology
is retained in the slimmed version.
